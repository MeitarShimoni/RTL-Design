# 8-bit Structural Ripple-Carry Adder

This project implements a structural 8-bit Ripple-Carry Adder (RCA) in Verilog. It was developed as part of the **Google & Reichman Tech School Chip Design & Verification** course.

The design is built from the ground up, starting with a 1-bit `Full_Adder` module, which is then instantiated 8 times to create the final 8-bit `Top_RCA` module.

## üñ•Ô∏è RCA Design Architecture

The design is a classic Ripple-Carry Adder. It is built from 8 instances of a 1-bit `Full_Adder` module. The carry-out (`Cout`) from each bit (starting at bit 0) is "rippled" to the carry-in (`Cin`) of the next bit, creating the carry chain.

### Micro-Architecture Diagram

This is the top-level block diagram for the 8-bit `Top_RCA` module, showing the 8 `Full_Adder` blocks chained together.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Results (Vivado)

The RTL schematic from the Vivado Elaborated Design view confirms the structural implementation. It clearly shows the 8 `Full_Adder` (FA) modules instantiated and connected in series, exactly as designed in the block diagram.

## üìä Verification & Simulation Results

The design was verified using a shared testbench (`tb_Top_RCA.sv`) that ran 5 directed test cases to check for various conditions (no carry, with carry, max value, max overflow).

### Simulation Waveform

This waveform snapshot shows the inputs (`a`, `b`, `cin`) changing over time and the corresponding correct output (`struct_sum`, `struct_cout`) for the structural adder.

### Simulation Console Output

The simulation output from the TCL console is shown below. All 5 assertions passed, confirming the structural adder (`struc_sum`, `struc_cout`) produced the correct results for all test cases.

*(Note: The log was edited to only show the structural adder's results for clarity)*
